# hello-world
My first github project.
Git - it is a version control system, developed by linus torvald(creator of linux os).
Github - it is a code sharing and collaboration platform.
>> it lets you and other team members to work on single project from anywhere.

Step 1) Create a Repository. (repository= hello-world)
A Repositry is usually used to organize a single project. a repository can contain folders,files,images and data sets etc.

Step 2) Create a Branch. (branch = feature)
-Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
-By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
-When you create a branch off the master branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Step 3) Make and commit changes
-On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
-Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
